	<h1>PayPal example 3</h1>

        <p>My <a href='./example10.html'>first example</a>--called "10" like BASIC lines were numbered--has all of the setup details.</p>
        
        <p>Now the goal is to get server-side control.  That is, to verify a purchase from my server directly to PayPal.  Otherwise put, one should never 
            believe anything that comes from the browser / client.  At least, not in this context.
             </p>
             
             <p>When you look at the JavaScript (control-U / view source) of the previous examples (and probably this one eventually), under "onApprove" is the .then(function(details...  "Details" is apt in that a lot 
                 of detail comes back, but all I need is to send details.id to the server for validation.
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>To use the server REST API, you'll need the client id and "secret."  The client id is public and, in this case, visible in the JavaScript.  
                 The secret is in the aforementioned (see example 1) dashboard / app entry.  The secret is just below the corresponding client id.</p>
                 
                 <p>Make the first <a href='https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/get-an-access-token-curl/'>"Get an Access Token" call</a>.  That results in 
                     JSON that includes "access_token":"A21AAL... [80 characters, I think]"  
                     
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>Then, using the details.id, make a call like the following, based on the <a href='https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/orders/v2/#orders_get'>orders</a> 
                     doc.  "8DC73665752701203" is the order id from details.id in the JavaScript.
                 </p>
                 
                 <pre>
curl -v -X GET "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/8DC73665752701203" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer A21AAL"
                 </pre>
                 
                 <p>That gives you JSON that will confirm (or deny) the order's completion, amount, shipping address, etc.
                     
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>I'm removing the PayPal button / JavaScript for now because it doesn't add anything to the previous example.  I'll put it back when I write the 
                 server code to do something.</p>
